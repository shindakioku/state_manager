### State manager

#### About

State Manager offers a streamlined API for efficiently managing diverse datasets with periodic updates. Simplifying the
development process, it consolidates your state management into a single, easy-to-use interface, eliminating the need
for cumbersome, disparate code segments.

#### Why

Why choose State Manager? Well, in every app, you've got data - it could be simple stuff, or more complex things stored
in different ways. Sometimes, you want to speed things up by using cached storage. But every time, you end up needing a
simple way to update, delete, or check that data. With State Manager, you get a single, easy-to-use toolkit that puts
you in control
